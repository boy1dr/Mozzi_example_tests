# Mozzi_example_tests
Testing various Arduino Mozzi synthesizer methods including LDR light control

See youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LXC0t8Xvn0



First experiments with the Mozzi library for synth sounds on Arduino. 

VERY surprising that the little nano's can do this, turns out the Leonardo also does well. 
Library can be found here: http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/ 

Thanks go to Tim Barrass, Awesome job! 

It was hard to get the WAV samples to play as well as make Synth noises but with a bit of creative coding i managed it. 

There is probably a different way to do it but there you go.
